# Unit 3: Libraries and Advanced Web

## 3.1 CSS Flexbox

### Learning Objectives
* Students can use Flexbox to layout web pages.
* Students can research features of CSS.
* Students understand increased levels of abstraction allow more complicated layouts with less code.
* Students can identify abstractions such as grow-to-fit and relative sizing. 

### Flexbox Simple Sample
Students should make new files *index.html* and *style.css* in their own new 3.1_Flexbox folder.  
#### Make a Sample HTML
Students create a sample HTML file they will use to style with flexbox. The walk through starts with an empty HTML file then fills the sections with randomly generated text and placeholder images. There are many sites that provide sample content. Here are the ones we used in the previous unit:
* [Random Text Generator](http://www.randomtextgenerator.com/)
* [Placeholder](https://placeholder.com/)
Have students look up the ```<article>``` and ```<section>``` tags. 
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Flex Simple Sample</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.2.css"> 
</head>
<body>
<header><h1>Flexbox Simple Sample</h1></header>
<section>
  <article>
    <h2>First Article</h2>
    <p>. . . . . . . . . . random text . . . . . . . . . . </p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h2>Second Article</h2>
    <p>. . . . . . . . . . random text . . . . . . . . . . </p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h2>Third Article</h2>
    <p>. . . . . . . . . . random text . . . . . . . . . . </p>
  </article>
</section>
</body>
</html>
```
#### Make a Sample CSS
Students make a sample CSS file. Students should create the CSS file shown. Then once they have saved both their HTML and CSS files have them open *index.html* in their browser.
```css
body {
    font-family: sans-serif;
}
header {
    background: navy;
    height: 100px;
    color: white;
}
h1 {
    text-align: center;
    line-height: 100px;
}
article {
    padding: 10px;
    margin: 10px;
    background: lightblue;
}
```
#### Create Flex Container
Students add flexbox containers to their files. The following CSS rule added to the end of the CSS file will make the section into a flex container.
```css
section {
    display: flex;
}
```
Have students save and reload their files. Now the random text should be arranged in a row instead of vertically. 
#### Documentation
Students should have a new *index.html* and *style.css* file to share.

### Flexbox Terminology
#### Containers and Items
Review the vocabulary of **items** and **containers**, emphasizing that items go in containers. Take time to review the image at the start of the lesson. 
#### Container Properties
Have students look up the listed properties and write down the purpose of each property.
#### Item Properties
Have students look up the listed properties and write down the purpose of each property.
#### Example on Codepen
This codepen is a good one to review as a class. As a class or in small groups have students explain what every element in the HTML and CSS do. Here are the parts to review.
##### HTML
```html
<section>
  <article id="one"><p>I</p></article>
  <article id="two"><p>II</p></article>
  <article id="three"><p>III</p></article>  
</section>
``` 
This creates a single section with three articles inside. ``` article``` and ```section``` act like named ```div``` elements.

## 3.2 CSS Grid
### Learning Objectives
* Students can use CSS Grid to layout web pages.
* Students can research features of CSS.
* Students understand increased levels of abstraction allow more complicated layouts with less code.
* Students can identify abstractions such as grid areas, grid tracks, and fractional.
CSS Grid allows designers to create responsive layouts easily using just CSS. Responsive layouts are webpages that resize depending on the size of the screen used to view them. Devices ranging from smartwatches to large monitors need to be able to view your sites. In this unit students will learn to create responsive websites.

#### Grid Basics
#### Spanning Columns
#### Grid Template
#### Responsive Behavior
#### Assignments
Students will use CSS grid to make their own sample responsive grid.
