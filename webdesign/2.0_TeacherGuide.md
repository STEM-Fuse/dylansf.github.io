# Unit 2: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

## 2.1 Style

### CSS Example
In this section students will apply styles to the simple HTML file we used in the last unit. Work through the styling as a class or have students work through at their own pace.

Student documentation should include the sample HTML file with styling. The styling used in this example is *internal* styling. This will be explored more in the next section. 

Example:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Style</title>
    <style>
    body{
      background-color: gray;
    }
    p {
      font-family: Arial;
      border: solid;
      background-color: lightgreen;
    }
    h1 {
      font-family: Arial;
      color: navy;
    }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Styling HTML with CSS</h1>
    <p>
        This is the paragraph section that we will learn to style first.
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```

### The CSS Language
#### Learning Objectives
* Students will be able to identify each part of a CSS rule: **selector, declaration, property, value**.
* Students will understand the syntax of a CSS rule including the placement of curly brackets ``` { } ```, colons ``` : ```, and semi-colons ``` ; ```. 
* Students will be able to compose CSS rules.
* Students will research CSS rules and properties.
* Students will observe the relationship between CSS rules and HTML elements

#### CSS Rules Style HTML Elements
Focus on the vocabulary: **selector, declaration, property, value**. Have students use the sample CSS example from the previous lesson to try each rule in the lesson. 
Students should create a copy of the CSS Cheat Sheet and research new properties at [W3Schools CSS Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp).

#### Documentation
Documentation for this section will be the creation of a CSS cheat sheet using Google Docs. 

### Internal, External, and Inline Styling
#### Learning Objectives
* Students can identify different types of styling. 
* Students can use inline, internal, or external CSS to style HTML.
#### Inline:
Styles are added inside HTML tags as in the following example.
```html
    <h1 style="font-family:Arial">Styling HTML with CSS</h1>
```
#### Internal
Styles are added to the HTML file, but inside a style tag in the head of the document.
```css
<style>
p {
    font-family: sans-serif;
}
</style>
```
#### External
CSS is saved in another file and referenced from the HTML file. In the following example there is an HTML file with a ```<link>``` tag and a CSS file with a CSS rule.

*index.html*
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Hi</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>
  <body>
    <p>Hi everybody!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

*style.css*
```css
p {
    font-family: sans-serif;
}
```
Here is an example of how those files would show up on the computer:

#### Documentation
Documentation for this section will be the creation of an external style sheet for the sample HTML file. Students should investigate what happens when they include an external style sheet, internal styling and inline styling in one page. They should see that external styles are overridden by internal styles which are overridden by inline styles. 

### Text Styling
#### Learning Objectives
* Students can tell the difference between a serif, sans-serif and monospace font. 
* Students will explore the different resources linked to in the lesson.

#### Typefaces
1. Serif: these typefaces have extra strokes on the ends of the lines called serifs. 
2. Sans-serif: these typefaces do not have serifs and are more modern looking.
3. Monospace: each letter is the same width. These are used on computers (like when coding in Visual Studio Code). Typewriters used monospace typefaces.
#### CSS For Styling Text
Declare  different degrees of specificity so that if the computer doesn't have the font you want it will fall back to the next best thing. 

Find more information at [W3Schools fonts page](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_font.asp)
#### Online Font Resources
Have students find different fonts they like using the resources given in the lesson.
* [Font Squirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/)
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
* [CSS Font Stack](https://www.cssfontstack.com/)

#### Documentation
Students will document their learning by styling one webpage with 3 different font combinations and recording their impressions of each. Have students think about what combination of header and paragraph fonts go well together. Have students look for examples from other websites and print sources.

### CSS Selectors

#### Learning Objectives
* Students will understand the use of type, universal, class, and ID selectors.
* Students will understand the syntax of each selector type including the special characters that denote each type (```*``` for universal, ```.``` for class,  ```#``` for ID).
* Students will be able to test their code using the [codpen.io](https://codepen.io/) website.
* Students will implement CSS rules they are given.
* Students will author new CSS rules.

#### [Codepen.io](https://codepen.io/)
Familiarize yourself with the codepen website before this unit. Codepen is a website that lets you modify HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and immediately see the results. We will use codepen extensively throughout the rest of the course. Codepen has many features and we encourage teachers to explore how it could work for them. Codepen can be used without an account, however having students make accounts will allow them to save their pens.

#### Random Text and Placeholder Images
Often designers need some images and text before they have the actual copy and photos they will put in their websites. For this purpose we will use these websites:

* [Random Text Generator](http://www.randomtextgenerator.com/)
* [Placeholder](https://placeholder.com/)

#### Universal Selector
The universal selector is denoted with an asterisk ```*```, and applies the rule to every element in the HTML file.
```css
* {
  background: lightblue;
}
```

#### Class Selector
Class selectors allow designers to specify a class inside HTML tags and to create a style that will apply to every member of that class. Emphasize for students that CSS class rules start with a period and then the class name.

The following HTML tag and CSS rule are an example of defining a class in HTML then styling with CSS.

HTML  
```html
<p class="intro">This text will be styled with the intro class</p>
```
CSS
```css
.intro {
    color: white;
    background: navy;
}
```
#### ID Selector
The ID selector is used to style a unique element. Each ID should only be applied to a single element. Styling an ID selector is done by adding a hash before the id name as in the following example.
HTML  
```html
<p id="intro">This text will be styled with the intro ID</p>
```
CSS
```css
#intro {
    color: white;
    background: navy;
}
```
#### Documentation
1. Students will create a codepen account.
2. Students will create a new pen using each of the selectors to style some HTML.
3. What happens with conflicting styles? The most specific style "wins". So a class will override a universal, and an ID will override a class. The order only matters for conflicting styles of the same type, then the last one "wins."

### Assignments
1. Students will style the webpages they created in the last unit. 
    1. Create a new folder with copies of the webpages from Unit 1. They should keep the original webpages as artifacts of their work.
    2. Style "About Me" with inline styling. Styling for this page should be inside each tag.
    3. Style "Favorite Animal" using internal styling.
    4. Style "Forms Cheat Sheet" with external style sheet.
2. Codepen: Create a new page in codepen using generated text and placeholder images. Include all the selector types. You can view their pen by viewing the link copied from the browser.

## 2.2 Color
### Color on the Computer
In this lesson students learn to represent colors as numbers. Color on a computer is represented by the numbers 0-255 controlling the amount of red, green and blue light coming from each pixel. Students will explore this then learn about hexadecimal representation of color.
### Color Palettes
Students will create color palettes using online tools. 
### Apply a Palette
Students will learn to use the color palettes they have created as CSS.
### Assignments
Students will apply the color palette CSS files to their previous HTML files. They should now have a consistent color theme for their web pages. Encourage them to stick with their palette going forward.

## 2.3 Layout
### Creating Blocks with <div> and <span>
In this section students are going to create colored blocks using ```<div>```. Students will position each block and see how a webpage flows. Each element is given a position based on when it shows up in a page.  
### Positioning with Float
Using float, students will learn how to bring objects out of the standard flow. This can be used to position images so that text flows around them. Also we will use float to make a grid of different color blocks. 
### Positioning with Flex
### Assignments

## 2.4 Boxes
### Box Dimensions
### Margins, Borders, and Padding
### Assignments

## 2.5 HTML5
### HTML5 Tags
### Styling HTML5
### Assignments
In this section students will make a portfolio site that will show the pages they have done so far. This will be a front page that will have navigation to each webpage they have made. The new front page will use HTML5 and be styled with CSS.
