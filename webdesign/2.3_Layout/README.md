## Creating Blocks with <div> and <span>

We will now learn to create content blocks. Content blocks don't directly change the way a webpage looks, instead they create content containers that we can modify using CSS.
To explore our <div> element we will create a div on a new Codepen. 
```html
<div>
<h1>This is our header</h1>
<p>Writing some text here. If you need to fill some text and you don't have anything to say you can
</div>

```

* Using @ to create different breakpoint

## Float
Float takes elements out of normal document flow and moves them around. This is a good way to get text to go around pictures etc.
