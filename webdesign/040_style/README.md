## What is style?
In a webpage style refers to all the ways you can change how a part of the page looks. You can change colors, sizes, place on the page, fonts, borders and much more. We will start by adding some background and text colors and with changing fonts. 

## Different Styling Methods
### Inline
```css
<p style="font-family: sans-serif;">
```
### Internal
```css
<style>
p {
    font-family: sans-serif;
}
</style>
```
### External
```css
p {
    font-family: sans-serif;
}
```

## Fonts
### Font Family
Declare  different degrees of specificity so that if the computer doesn't have the font you want it will fall back to the next best thing.
