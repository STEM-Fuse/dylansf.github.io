### Documentation

## Box Model
* Margin
* Border
* Padding
* Content

To see the content box, specify background color. The content runs right to the edge of the background color. To make the text not run right into the edge of the background color, add padding (for example 20px). This will "pad" the text. Now we can add a border. This will start where the padding ends. Now we are going to change the margins and see what happens.
