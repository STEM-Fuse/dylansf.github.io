# Guessing Game
We will now create a guessing game. The game will choose a random number between 1 and 100, then challenge a player to guess the right number. After each wrong guess, the player will be told if their guess was too high or too low. We will keep a list of guesses visible for the player. The game ends after they get the right number. When the game is over, the player can restart the game. 

## Break into simple parts
1. Generate a random number 
2. Create a spot to type in the number and a button to submit the guess
3. Display the guess
4. Check if number is correct
5. If guess is correct:
    1. Show correct answer message
    2. Turn off answer submission 
    3. Create restart button
6. If guess is wrong
    1. Display wrong answer message with hint (too low or too high)
    2. Allow player in enter another guess.
7. When the game restarts, reset everything
