# Unit 1: Introduction to Web Design

## 1.1 Simple Sample (1 hour)
This is the starting point for our exploration of HTML. Use this file to get a basic understanding of HTML. Discuss the difference between source code (the raw HTML) and the rendered page (the page as seen in the browser). 
Students should type the sample.html file into Visual Studio Code. They should open the saved file with Google Chrome or another web browser. 
Students that finish early should explore on their own by making modifications and seeing what happens. 


## 2.2 Getting Started 
### Learning Targets:
* Students know what makes a markup language is.
* Students know what tags are
* Students understand tag syntax 

### What is a “markup language”
Review this section with students. Students should begin a vocabulary list. 
Documentation: each lesson has a documentation section. This can be a physical notebook or an online document such as a google doc. Checking documentation is a good formative assessment for students.
