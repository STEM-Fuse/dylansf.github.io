# Business Time

# Pitch
## Half Baked
The purpose of this activity is to prepare students for the pitch. Students get a random noun and adverb and they have to build a business around the combined words. The activity should be fun and silly, but it gets students in the mindset of pitching their ideas to the class. 
1. Get a list of nouns then adjectives from the students.
Use post-its or index cards to record the the words. Ask students to shout out nouns and record them. Once you have 15-20 nouns switch to adjectives (you may have to remind students that these are "describing" words). Once you have 15-20 adjectives it is time to make groups. 
2. Assign groups and give each group a random adjective-noun combo 
Decide how many groups you want and have students count off. Get students into their groups and have each group choose a facilitator. Once each group has a facilitator, call the facilitators up and have them randomly select an adjective and a noun. You can do this by having them draw a card or pull a couple post-its off the wall with their eyes closed. Of course you can just assign them a pair if you like. 
3. Explain the pitch
Students need to create a business from those 2 words. For example if your words were "Fuzzy Window" your group would have to invent a company, say what they do and how they make money. Maybe "Fuzzy Window" makes transparent fur and they market it for fancy winter wear. It doesn't matter what, just that you come up with something. Optionally, on a large piece of chart paper have students write their business name (the 2 words) and then sketch a logo. Be prepared to present in 5 minutes.  
4. 5 minutes to come up with an idea for a business based on noun and verb.
During the 5 minutes encourage students to give input and participate with their groups.
5. 1 minute pitch 
Each group will now present their idea in front of the class. Use a timer and limit the pitch to exactly 1 minute! Be strict and cut off groups that go long.
6. Vote
Once all the ideas are presented students will vote on each pitch. the purpose of this is to get students used to the idea of voting so they are ready to vote when the next pitches happen. Lay out each pitch paper on a table or stick them to the wall. Give students 3 stickers each. they can vote on a pitch by sticking a sticker to the pitch. They can vote for a different pitch for each sticker or put multiple stickers on one pitch. the pitch with the most stickers after voting wins.
## Pitch
For this activity every student will prepare to pitch an idea to the class. Students will need a pitch paper of some kind -- notebook, large post-it, chart paper, anything that they can put up and will fit the voting stickers. 
1. Students prepare to pitch. Everyone should pitch an idea. If they are struggling to come up with anything encourage them to think about problems they would like to solve. They can think about modifications to existing ideas or new ideas, or silly ideas. Make sure students come up with a title and that they write that on the top of their pitch paper. They can put sketches, bullet points, or anything else they want to display during their pitch on the rest of the paper. 
A good form for the pitch is something like:
Hi I'm [name] and I'm pitching [title]. The problem I wan to solve is [problem]. My idea for how to solve this problem is by [solution].

2. 1-Minute Pitch (Make sure you have time for pitches and voting in 1 class period)
Each student will now pitch their idea in front of the class. Students should hold their pitch-paper facing out and tell the class about their idea. Coach students to hold their pitch paper facing out towards the class, speak clearly and loud enough to be heard, with their head and body facing out to the class. Give students 1 minute to pitch - be strict and cut them off right at 1 minute! Once they finish their pitch, stick their pitch paper to the wall, or lay it out on a table where it is easy to see and there are no overlaps. 
3. Vote
Give each student 3 stickers and have them vote on the pitches. Students can use all 3 stickers on one pitch they really like, or distribute stickers over different pitches however they like. 
4. Find the top 6 (or however many groups you want)
Here are two possibilities for how to count votes:
    1. As a class: Have everyone collect their pitch paper. Ask everyone who got one vote to stand. Now have students with just 1 vote sit. Now have students with just 2 votes sit. Keep going until you have 6 standing. You may have to come up with quick tiebreakers in the event that you can't get the exact number of groups you would like (flip a coin, rock-paper-scissors, etc.)
    2. Teacher count: Collect all the pitch papers and find the top 6 pitches. 

5. Top 6 (or whatever number works) re-pitch then choose groups
    1. Have the top 6 remind the class of their ideas. 
    2. Assign groups. You can do this randomly or however you like. Here are some grouping idea:
    * Have a draft, with the highest voted pitch going first. Students select their group members one-at-a-time
    * Count off
    * Self selected

# Problem Statement
Solutions should have a problem focus. That is students should spend time deciding what problem they want to solve, instead of starting with solutions. Often the pitch will be for a particular solution, but now students need to refocus to try and get a good understanding of the problem. 
## Ways to Understand Problems
1. 5 W's
    * Who is this a problem for?
    * What is the issue? 
    * When does this problem occur?
    * Where is this a problem?
    * Why is it important to solve the problem?
2. Ideal, reality, consequence 
## Parts of the Problem Statement
1. What problem are you trying to solve?
2. Problem validation
## Present the Problem -- No Solutions!
Groups will now present their problem statement.

# Solution
Now students will start to plan their solution

# MVP

# Final Pitch
