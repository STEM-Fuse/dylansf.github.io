    <p style="text-align:justify">Welcome to our updated Web Design Course! We are dedicated to providing a course that uses industry standard skills and delivers content knowledge applicable throughout the wide and changing world of web technologies. The new course will cover HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and use these tools to build websites and explore programming. The course will focus on the development of real world portfolio projects that students can use to demonstrate their workplace skills. In addition, long time users of our web course can expect a more iterative learning cycle with streamlined projects and clear learning targets for each lesson. Projects are smaller with more applicable impact. We have moved away from any particular content management system to focus more on technologies used broadly throughout industry.</p>
    
    <p style="text-align:justify">Build portfolio projects to demonstrate your industry relevant skills. Within each Unit folder, the following content is included: <font size="2"> </font></p>
