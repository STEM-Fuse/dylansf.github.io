<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>The AP Computer Science Principles course is designed to be equivalent to a first-
    semester introductory college computing course. In this course, students will
    develop computational thinking skills vital for success across all disciplines, such
    as using computational tools to analyze and study data and working with large
    data sets to analyze, visualize, and draw conclusions from trends. The course
    engages students in the creative aspects of the field by allowing them to develop
    computational artifacts based on their interests. Students will also develop effective
    communication and collaboration skills by working individually and collaboratively
    to solve problems, and will discuss and write about the impacts these solutions
    could have on their community, society, and the world.</p>
