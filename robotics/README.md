# Robotics

This course is an introduction to robotics. Robotics is a broad field that encompasses controlling movement through programmed interactions of human input and sensors and automatic mechanical and electrical processes. In this introduction you will learn some of the most common control methods, basic programming, as well as plan and execute robotics projects of your own.

## What is a robot?

"Robot" is a very broad term. In science fiction robots have been portrayed as characters that are mechanical and electric, but still have agency of their own. Think R2D2 or C3PO, kitt, johnny 5, etc. This is one realization of robots and may companies build toys that attempt to act like many different parts of these fictional robots. However robots are also used widely in industry. Factories use robots to move parts, weld, place, pick, sort and all other kinds of tasks. In fact, modern factories themselves are often very complicated robots in which you put materials into various places and products come out the other end. 

Robots exits in homes. A roomba is a robot that cleans floors. Now more than ever before standard home appliances have been given sensors and processors that make them more and more into robots as well. 

Robotics competitions are growing ever more common. 

For us, "robot" is a catch-all term that means you will have some combination of sensors, information processing, and mechanical design.

## Skills needed in robotics
1. Mechanics
2. Electronics
3. Programming
4. Design Process (testing and fixing)

## Idea for this course
In this course we are going to use several different low cost kits, 3D printed parts, and materials easily obtained from a hardware store. Work will be focused on learning concepts and applying these concepts to projects.

## List of topics 
* DC Motors
* PID
* Simple Machines
* Gears, belts and pulleys
* Pivots
* Drive
* Scrub
* Sensors
